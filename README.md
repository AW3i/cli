# valet-sh CLI

Go-based CLI that orchestrates Ansible playbooks for managing local development
environments for Magento, PHP, and other projects. When invoked with no
arguments it launches an interactive Bubble Tea TUI; with arguments it shows a
live execution panel and delegates to Ansible.

---

## Architecture

### Entry Point

`cmd/valet/main.go` — Cobra root command. Commands are auto-discovered from
`playbooks/*.yml` header annotations at startup. On every invocation:

1. Periodic update check (weekly, skipped for `--help`/`--version`)
2. No args → TUI launcher (`tui.Run`) → on command selection → `tui.RunWithPanel`
3. Args on TTY → execution panel (`tui.RunWithPanel`)
4. Args on non-TTY (CI/pipe) → `syscall.Exec` into `ansible-playbook` directly

### Command Auto-Discovery

Commands are **not** defined in Go. `commands.Discover(repoDir)` scans
`playbooks/*.yml` at startup and builds cobra commands from header annotations:

```yaml
# @command:     "service"
# @description: "start/stop or enable/disable a service"
# @usage:       "valet.sh service <start|stop|restart|enable|disable|default> svc"
# @help:
# start: start a valet-sh service
# valet.sh service start mysql80
```

| Annotation | cobra field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `@command` | `cmd.Annotations["playbook"]` | Canonical playbook name, e.g. `project:env` |
| `@description` | `cmd.Short` | Shown in list and TUI launcher |
| `@usage` | `cmd.Use` | `valet.sh ` prefix is stripped |
| `@help` | `cmd.Long` | Multi-line block until `---` separator |

Playbooks with a colon in `@command` (e.g. `project:env`) are automatically
grouped: `project` becomes a parent cobra command with `env` as a subcommand.

**Adding a new command = adding a new `playbooks/<name>.yml` with annotations.**
No Go code needs to be written or modified.

### TUI Package (`internal/tui/`)

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `launcher.go` | Navigation-only model: command bar, inline box, quits with `Result.Args` on Enter |
| `list.go` | `CommandItem` (list.Item), custom delegate, arg parsing from cobra `Use` |
| `args.go` | Argument input pane (`bubbles/textinput` per arg) |
| `exec.go` | `ExecModel`: live log panel, `debug.log` tail, log viewer on failure |
| `runner.go` | `RunWithPanel()` entry point, `waitForFirstTask()` gate, `standaloneExecModel` |
| `inline.go` | Inline command box (arg input + docs display) |
| `styles.go` | Lip Gloss styles matching the Ansible callback colour palette |

**Screen state machine:**

```
screenList    →  (enter on leaf)  →  screenInline
screenInline  →  (enter)          →  [launcher quits, Result.Args set]
                                      → main.go calls RunWithPanel
                                          → waitForFirstTask() blocks
                                          → BubbleTea exec panel starts
screenExec    →  (done, failure)  →  logViewOpen = true
```

**Two execution paths:**

| Path | Used when | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `ansible.Run()` | Non-TTY / direct cobra dispatch | `syscall.Exec` — replaces current process |
| `ansible.RunSubprocess()` | TUI panel | `exec.Cmd.Start()` — Go stays alive for log tailing |

### Password Handling & TUI Startup Gate

Ansible playbooks that require privilege escalation declare `vars_prompt` for
`ansible_become_pass`. Go **never touches the password** — Ansible handles it
natively via its own prompt mechanism.

#### How it works

`RunSubprocess` passes `cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin` to the Ansible subprocess.
When the playbook starts, Ansible's `vars_prompt` prompts for the password on
the raw terminal. Go gates BubbleTea startup on `waitForFirstTask()`.

#### The startup gate (`waitForFirstTask`)

The valet-sh callback plugin (`plugins/callback/valet-sh.py`) writes to the
subprocess's stdout in this order:

```
1. \033[?25h          — CURSOR_SHOW, at module import (first byte 0x1B)
2. ▶ play-name\n      — v2_playbook_on_play_start, before vars_prompt
3.                    — vars_prompt fires here; Ansible reads password from stdin
4. ⠙ task-name\r      — v2_playbook_on_task_start, first task starts
```

`waitForFirstTask()` reads the stdout pipe byte-by-byte, buffering everything,
until it detects the 2-byte UTF-8 prefix `\xe2\xa0` — which uniquely
identifies a Braille spinner character (U+2800..U+28FF). This prefix only
appears at step 4, guaranteeing that `vars_prompt` (step 3) has completed and
stdin is free before BubbleTea takes over.

**Why `\xe2\xa0` and not just `\xe2`?**

Both the spinner characters and the play-start `▶` (U+25B6) start with `\xe2`.
The spinner chars (U+2800..U+28FF) all have `\xe2\xa0` as their first two
bytes, while `▶` encodes as `\xe2\x96\xb6` (second byte `0x96`). Checking two
bytes avoids triggering the gate on the play-start line.

| Character | Codepoint | UTF-8 | Triggers gate? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `⠙` (spinner) | U+2819 | `\xe2\xa0\x99` | Yes |
| `▶` (play-start) | U+25B6 | `\xe2\x96\xb6` | No |
| ESC (CURSOR_SHOW) | — | `\x1b...` | No |

All bytes consumed while waiting are returned via `io.MultiReader` so the exec
panel receives the complete, unmodified stdout stream.

**If Ansible exits before any task** (e.g. syntax error, missing playbook),
the stdout pipe closes. `waitForFirstTask` returns the buffered bytes and
`runExecPanel` starts immediately, receiving `execDoneMsg` with the error.

#### TUI launcher path

The launcher is navigation-only. On Enter, it stores `selectedArgs` and returns
`tea.Quit`. `tui.Run()` returns `Result{Args: selectedArgs}`. `main.go` then
calls `RunWithPanel(root, result.Args, Version)` on the clean terminal after
BubbleTea has torn down — so `vars_prompt` fires on the raw terminal, then the
exec panel BubbleTea starts after `waitForFirstTask` unblocks.

---

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Go orchestrates, Ansible executes** — the Go CLI adds UX (auto-discovery,
   typed validation, help, TUI) but all heavy lifting remains in Ansible.

2. **`syscall.Exec` for non-interactive** — signals (Ctrl-C) flow directly to
   `ansible-playbook`, Go process vanishes from the process table. Used when
   stdout is not a TTY.

3. **`RunSubprocess` for TUI** — Go stays alive to tail `debug.log` and render
   the scrollable execution panel while Ansible runs.

4. **Ansible owns the password** — `ansible_become_pass` is never collected,
   stored, or passed by Go. `vars_prompt` in the playbook handles it natively
   via the raw terminal. `waitForFirstTask()` gates BubbleTea startup on the
   first spinner character so stdin is free during the password prompt.

5. **No `//nolint` comments** — use `.golangci.yml` exclusions with an
   explanation.

6. **Bubble Tea value receivers** — required by the Elm architecture.
   `hugeParam` warnings are excluded in `.golangci.yml` for all `internal/tui/`
   files. Do not convert to pointer receivers.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.22+
- `golangci-lint` v1.64.8 (auto-installed by `make lint`)

### Build

```bash
make build          # Build for current OS/arch → dist/valet
make build-all      # Cross-compile for all 4 platforms → dist/
make install        # Build + copy to /usr/local/valet-sh/bin/valet
```

### Test

```bash
make test           # go test -race ./...
make test-coverage  # Run with coverage report printed to stdout
```

### Lint

```bash
make lint           # golangci-lint run (auto-installs if missing)
make lint-ci        # go mod download + golangci-lint (mirrors CI exactly)
make quality        # fmt-check + vet + mod-verify + lint
```

### Before Every Push

```bash
make lint && go test -race ./... && go build ./...
```

All three must pass. Commit only after they do.

---

## Configuration

### `.valet-sh.yml` Format

```yaml
hub:
  host: "git.example.com"
  port: 22
  path: "/data"
services:
  php:
    version: 8.1
  mariadb:
    version: 10.6
    database: magento
  elasticsearch:
    version: 7
    plugins: ["analysis-icu"]
instance:
  key: "myproject"     # hostname: myproject.test
  type: "magento2"     # bootstrap workflow
  path: "src"          # docroot
```

### Supported instance types

`magento2`, `magento1`, `neos`, `aem`, `orocrm`

---

## Commands

Commands are auto-discovered from `playbooks/*.yml` header annotations. To add
a command, add a new playbook with the required annotations — no Go code needed.

Commands that require a valid `.valet-sh.yml` in the current directory (`link`,
`init-instance`) have a `PreRunE` hook registered by `commands.ApplyHooks()`.

All commands follow the same runtime pattern:

1. `commands.Discover()` builds the cobra command from playbook annotations
2. Cobra parses args; `hooks.go` validates `.valet-sh.yml` if needed
3. `resolveRunOpts()` builds `ansible.RunOpts` (reads `cmd.Annotations["playbook"]`)
4. On TTY: `ansible.RunSubprocess()` + `waitForFirstTask()` + exec panel
5. On non-TTY: `ansible.Run()` → `syscall.Exec` into `ansible-playbook`

---

## Release Process

1. Tag with `v*` pattern: `git tag v2.10.0 && git push origin v2.10.0`
2. GitHub Actions builds 4 binaries:
   - `valet-linux-amd64`, `valet-linux-arm64`
   - `valet-darwin-amd64`, `valet-darwin-arm64`
3. Binaries + `checksums.txt` attached to GitHub Release
4. `valet-sh/installer` downloads the appropriate binary on `setup`/`update`

## golangci-lint Exclusions

| Path | Linter | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `internal/commands/help.go` | `errcheck` | `fmt.Fprintln` to stdout is best-effort |
| `internal/commands/helpers.go` | `errcheck` | `cmd.Help()` stdout errors are non-critical |
| `internal/updater/check.go` | `errcheck` | File close and HTTP body close are best-effort |
| `internal/tui/` | `gocritic/hugeParam` | Bubble Tea requires value receivers — intentional by design |
| `internal/tui/exec.go` | `errcheck` | Best-effort file/viewport operations |
| `internal/tui/runner.go` | `errcheck` | Best-effort workdir lookup |
| `internal/tui/exec.go` | `gosec/G304` | `tailFile()` always receives the hardcoded `logPath` constant |
| All | `gosec/G204` | `syscall.Exec` with trusted argv is intentional |

---

## Security Notes

- `syscall.Exec` argv is constructed from platform constants + cobra-parsed args
- `tailFile()` path is always the hardcoded `logPath` constant, not user input
- `go.sum` pins exact SHA-256 hashes for all Go module dependencies
- Ansible's `ansible_become_pass` is never collected or stored by Go;
  `vars_prompt` in the playbook prompts natively on the raw terminal
- `waitForFirstTask()` gates BubbleTea on `\xe2\xa0` (Braille spinner prefix),
  ensuring stdin is free before BubbleTea takes ownership
